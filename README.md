Customized Xen HTML Widgets Storage
===

A collection of Xen HTML widgets I have made from scratch or customized from source.

I may not be the original creator of these widgets, I am just storing them here as a cloud backup for myself so I keep any changes I made. If you like the changes, feel free to clone and use them!

* Google Search 2021 - The original source was called "Search Widget 2015". I found it on HackYouriPhone but it did not work for iOS 14. I modified the code to bring back the search and voice functionalities, migrated the old config files to the new config.json file and added my own customizations such as choose your own search engine / voice assistant!
* [At a Gaze](https://github.com/SlackinJack/XenHTML-Pixel-Widgets) - I modified the language to italian for days / weeks. I'm only saving this here so I have a backup of my changes, I suggest downloading from the actual linked repo in case he adds any updates / changes.
